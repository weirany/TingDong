## Philosophy
The key to listening is to form a concept directly from the what you heard, without first converting it into the spelling of an English word, and then from spelling to Chinese. Many so-called illiterates (either Chinese or English) do not know reading and writing. But that does not hinder their ability to listen and speak. In fact, languages were invented at the same time when humans become humans. But the written form of the same language came much later.
